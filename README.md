## Wordle Cheater 
Use Wordle Helper to find possible words (e.g., *cheat*) while you're playing Wordle. 
___
## How to Cheat:
* For this example, consider the *December 16th, 2022* game.  On that day:
* The answer was the word **probe**
  * My first word that I entered in Wordle was **slate**
    * Wordle returned <img src="slate.png">
  * My next word that I entered in Wordle was **minor**
    * Wordle returned <img src="minor.png">
  * My next word was **chore**
    * Wordle returned <img src="chore.png">
___

## At this point, I started cheating by accessing the index.html page:
### http://billybyte.com/wordl/index.html

## I entered the word ```slate``` in the box to the right of **Enter A Word ->**
<img src="wordle_screen_1.png">

## I clicked on the ```GREEN button``` underneath the letter **E** in ```SLATE```, and the letter **E** turned GREEN.  (I left the other letters grey).

## I clicked on the ```Add A Word``` button, which added the word ```SLATE``` below the button.

## I repeated the same process for the word ```minor```:
* Enter minor in the box to the right of **Enter A Word ->**
* Click on the GOLD color for the **O**
* Click on the GOLD color for the **R**
* Click the **Add A Word** button

## Now I hit ```Find All Possible Words``` (i.e., I cheated):
<img src="slate_minor_results.png">

## The most probable word was ```force```, so I entered that:
* Wordle returned <img src="force.png">


## ```Find All Possible Words``` returned:
<img src="slate_minor_force.png">

## The most probable word was ```prove```, so I entered that:
* Wordle returned <img src="prove.png">

## ```Find All Possible Words``` returned:
<img src="slate_minor_force_prove.png">

## This showed ```probe``` as the only possible solution, which was the actual Wordle solution.
